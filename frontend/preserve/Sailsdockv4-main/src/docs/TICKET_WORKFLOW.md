## Ticket Data Model

Each ticket in the system contains the following data:

- **Basic Information**: title, description, creation date, due date
- **Status**: current state in the workflow (see [Ticket Statuses](#ticket-statuses))
- **Priority**: urgency level (see [Priority Levels](#priority-levels))
- **Business Association**: linked business record (optional for initially unassigned tickets)
- **Contact Association**: specific contact person within the business
- **Assignee**: team member responsible for handling the ticket
- **Creator**: user or system that created the ticket
- **Comments**: communication thread related to the ticket
- **Tags**: categorization labels
- **Resolution**: date of resolution and any resolution notes

## Ticket Statuses

Tickets progress through these statuses during their lifecycle:

1. **Unassigned**: New tickets that haven't been associated with a business yet
2. **Open**: Assigned to a business but not actively being worked on
3. **In Progress**: Actively being worked on by a team member
4. **Waiting on Customer**: Pending customer response or action
5. **Waiting on Third Party**: Pending action from an external vendor or partner
6. **Resolved**: Issue has been addressed but awaiting final confirmation
7. **Closed**: Ticket is complete and requires no further action

## Priority Levels

Tickets are assigned one of four priority levels:

1. **Low**: Non-urgent issues that can be addressed when time permits
2. **Medium**: Standard issues requiring attention within regular service levels
3. **High**: Important issues that should be prioritized above medium and low tasks
4. **Urgent**: Critical issues requiring immediate attention, potentially affecting business operations

## Ticket Creation Process

Tickets can be created in multiple ways:

1. **Customer Initiated**:
   - Web form submissions
   - Email to support
   - Phone calls (manually entered by support)

2. **Internal Creation**:
   - Support staff creating tickets on behalf of customers
   - System-generated tickets from automated monitoring

### Required Information

At minimum, a new ticket requires:
- Title
- Description
- Contact information for follow-up

For unassigned tickets, customer contact details are stored in the `submitterName`, `submitterEmail`, and `submittedCompanyName` fields.

## Ticket Assignment

### Business Assignment

Unassigned tickets should be reviewed and associated with the appropriate business record:

1. Search for the business in the CRM
2. If found, link the ticket to the business
3. If not found, consider creating a new business record

### Agent Assignment

Tickets are assigned to team members based on:
- Expertise (matched by ticket tags)
- Workload balancing
- Business relationship (account managers)

## Working with Tickets

### Status Transitions

Typical workflow progression:

1. Unassigned → Open (after business assignment)
2. Open → In Progress (when work begins)
3. In Progress → Waiting on Customer/Third Party (when additional information is needed)
4. Waiting on Customer/Third Party → In Progress (when information is received)
5. In Progress → Resolved (when solution is implemented)
6. Resolved → Closed (after final confirmation)

### Due Dates

- Set appropriate due dates based on priority and SLAs
- Overdue tickets are flagged in the interface for attention
- Due dates can be adjusted with proper justification

## Communication and Comments

### Comment Types

- **Internal Comments**: Visible only to team members, marked with `isInternal: true`
- **External Comments**: Visible to customers, included in email notifications

### Best Practices

- Keep communications professional and constructive
- Document all key decisions and action items
- When changing status, add a comment explaining the reason
- Include links to relevant resources or documentation when applicable

## Ticket Resolution

### Resolution Process

1. Implement the solution or address the issue
2. Document the resolution in a comment
3. Change status to "Resolved"
4. Notify the customer
5. After customer confirmation, close the ticket

### Follow-up

- For complex issues, schedule a follow-up check after resolution
- For recurring issues, consider creating preventative measures

## Tags and Categorization

Tickets should be tagged for better organization and reporting:

- Issue type (e.g., "technical", "invoicing", "account")
- Product area affected
- Root cause categories
- Special handling requirements (e.g., "urgent")

## Reporting and Analytics

The ticket system provides several reporting capabilities:

- Ticket volume by status, priority, and tag
- Average resolution time
- Customer satisfaction metrics
- Agent performance metrics
- Recurring issue identification
